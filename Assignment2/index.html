            Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
            Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison
            to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent
            throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat
            has been variously adapted to regional tastes. Chicken can be prepared
            in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing,
            frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose.
            Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become
            a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful
            than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.
            The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on
            a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed
            countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods,
            while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming
            techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens
            on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one

          <section>
            Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting
            into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon,
            sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.),
            while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings,
            on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner
            (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages.
            The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts
            that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail,
            liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly
            the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the
            brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform
            encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys,
            and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries,
            prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked
            and eaten as is,[3] but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage
            casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger
            cows (calves) is called veal.

            Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese
            dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with
            some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta),
            such as seafood, often raw, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits.
            Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient
            is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).
            Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be
            prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared
            with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation
            crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with
            pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled
            daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.Sushi is sometimes
            confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists
            of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional
            serving of rice.
